# Anthony Blog.

This small project was designed for demostration purpose only. My goal here was <br> to show my Angular skills by adapting the [Material UI](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit) template from Creative Tim.

## Content
You will see a few number of components created in the project. This also can help you if you want to download the source code and <br> start coding a similar project, you are going to save time by adapting it (that's what I did) and start creating new things. **Let your mind fly**!

Folder structure described as follow: 

| Folder  | Brief description |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Shared      | Components that will be displayed throughout the entire webpage.|
| Services      | Services to handle some tasks throughout the components.     |
| Pipes      | Files to handle some kind of filtering tasks (i.e: check some URL)     |
|    Pages    |  Pages/Views that you are going to render in your application.  |
| Components | Pieces or blocks of code that you can reuse through your entire app. |
| Auth | This component here was just to handle the user data separately. |

<br>

> **Note**: Each folder has it own module. Be sure to do the correct <br> implementations when you are generating new components.

## How to run the project.

First of all, be sure you have installed the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli). You can also check their documentation.

Then, go to the folder project and run this command in the terminal: `npm install`

After that, you will have all  the required modules and dependencies to run the project. <br>
Now to compile the project you need to type in the terminal: `ng serve`

That command will compile your files in development mode. You will be able to see the <br> page in your browser. Type <span style="color:blue"> `localhost:4200` </span> and take a look!

> **Note**: To better understanding on how Angular works, please read their [documentation.](https://angular.io/docs)

## Final notes

* If you want to remove or optimize the spinner, go check in the modules into which <br> they have been imported. It was created manually just to show it.

* You can also go to my other repositories and see the structure of my apps (they <br> are not documentated, I was so lazy tbh).

* I'm also looking for a job. So don't hesitate if you want to contact me. Send me a message <br> I'm available in all my social media apps.

* If you liked this work, please star the repository, I'm also receiving feedbacks of what could be done better. <br> Thank you!
